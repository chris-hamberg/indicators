    Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) Indicator.

    Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator
    that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a securityâ€™s price.
    It consists of the MACD line, Signal line, and Histogram.

    Parameters:
    timeseries (pd.DataFrame, or Stock): The input financial time series.
    short (int): The short-term Exponential Moving Average (EMA) period.
    long (int): The long-term EMA period.
    signal (int): The signal EMA period.
    dimension (str): The target column in the timeseries to use for calculation.

    Returns:
    np.ndarray: Containing the MACD line, Signal line, and Histogram values.
